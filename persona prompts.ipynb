            "To design a secure authentication flow for a React + Node.js web application, we will implement a JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication system. The flow will involve user registration, login, and authentication using JWT. We will ensure validation and verification at each step to prevent unauthorized access.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Final Answer**\n",
            "The secure authentication flow will consist of the following steps:\n",
            "1. **User Registration**: The user will register by providing a username, email, and password. The password will be hashed and stored in the database.\n",
            "2. **User Login**: The user will login by providing their username and password. The password will be verified against the stored hash.\n",
            "3. **JWT Generation**: Upon successful login, a JWT will be generated with a payload containing the user's ID and other relevant information. The JWT will be signed with a secret key.\n",
            "4. **JWT Lifecycle**:\n",
            "   - **Token Generation**: The JWT will be generated with a specific expiration time (e.g., 1 hour).\n",
            "   - **Token Refresh**: Before the token expires, the client will send a refresh request to the server. If the token is valid, a new token will be generated and returned to the client.\n",
            "   - **Token Revocation**: If the user logs out or the token is compromised, the token will be revoked and added to a blacklist.\n",
            "5. **Validation and Verification**: At each step, the user's input will be validated and verified to prevent unauthorized access. This includes:\n",
            "   - **Username and Password Validation**: The username and password will be validated against the stored values.\n",
            "   - **JWT Verification**: The JWT will be verified against the secret key and checked for expiration and revocation.\n",
            "6. **Protected Routes**: The client will send the JWT with each request to protected routes. The server will verify the JWT before granting access to the route.\n",

            "To design a Retrieval, Augmentation, and Generation (RAG) pipeline for a company FAQ chatbot, we need to consider the chatbot's primary function: providing accurate and relevant answers to user queries. The Retrieval step involves fetching relevant information from a knowledge base, the Augmentation step involves refining or expanding the retrieved information, and the Generation step involves creating a response based on the augmented information.\n",
            "\n",
            "Final Answer: \n",
            "The RAG pipeline for the company FAQ chatbot will consist of:\n",
            "1. Retrieval: Utilize a dense passage retriever (DPR) to fetch relevant FAQ entries from the company's knowledge base.\n",
            "2. Augmentation: Apply a sequence-to-sequence model to refine the retrieved entries, ensuring they are up-to-date, accurate, and contextually relevant to the user's query.\n",
            "3. Generation: Employ a text generation model to create a clear, concise, and user-friendly response based on the augmented information.\n",
            "\n",
            "Verification Checklist:\n",
            "- Does the pipeline effectively retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base?\n",
            "- Are the retrieved entries accurately refined and expanded during the augmentation step?\n",
            "- Does the generation step produce clear, concise, and contextually relevant responses to user queries?\n",
            "- Are the responses consistent with the company's tone and language?\n",
            "- Is the pipeline scalable and able to handle a high volume of user queries?\n",
