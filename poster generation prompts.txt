Title: “The Missed Call”
I used to ignore my phone when it rang late at night. Always thought, I’ll call back tomorrow.
Every night at 11:47, the same number called. No name. Just a number.
One night, annoyed, I picked up.
Silence.
Then breathing. Slow. Tired.
A voice finally said, “Wrong number… sorry to bother you.”
The calls stopped after that.
Weeks passed. Life moved. Exams, deadlines, noise.
Then one evening, my mom asked casually, “Did you ever talk to your grandfather?”
I laughed. “He never calls me.”
She went quiet.
“He used to,” she said. “Every night. Around 11:47. He forgot how to save contacts.”
The room shrank.
She continued, softer, “He said hearing your voice helped him sleep. Even if you didn’t talk.”
I checked my call history. Deleted. Clean. Empty.
That night, at 11:47, my phone stayed silent.
I waited anyway.
For a ring that wouldn’t come. For a voice that needed nothing— Just proof it wasn’t alone.
Now I pick up every call.
Even the wrong ones.
Because sometimes, someone isn’t calling for answers.
They’re calling to feel remembered.
